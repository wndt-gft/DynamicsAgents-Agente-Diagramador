VALIDATION CRITERIA

1. Syntax Validation (CRITICAL)

Cypress/Playwright (JavaScript/TypeScript):
- Valid JavaScript/TypeScript syntax
- Balanced brackets
- Proper async/await usage
- Valid framework method calls
- NO arbitrary waits
- NO brittle selectors

Karate (Gherkin + Karate DSL):
- Valid Gherkin structure: Feature, Scenario, Background, Given/When/Then
- Proper Karate DSL syntax: match, path, method, status, request, response
- Comments MUST use hash (#) NOT double-slash (//)
- Variable definitions: * def, * set
- Valid path construction: path '/resource/', id (paths MUST start with /)
- Proper function calls: call, callonce, read()
- NO karate.parallel() - does not exist
- Balanced braces, brackets, and quotes
- Valid HTTP methods: get, post, put, patch, delete
- Proper header syntax: And header Authorization = 'Bearer ' + token
- Schema markers: #string, #number, #boolean, #array, #uuid, #object
- Status validation required: Then status 200

Newman (Postman JSON):
- Valid JSON structure
- Proper collection schema
- Valid JavaScript in test scripts
- NO syntax errors in test blocks

Appium (Java with Cucumber + JUnit):
- Valid Java syntax and structure
- MUST follow Cucumber-JUnit architecture with ONLY three types of classes:
  * Page Objects: Classes representing app screens (e.g., LoginPage.java, HomePage.java)
  * Step Definitions: Classes with step implementations annotated with @Given, @When, @Then
  * Feature Files: Gherkin .feature files with scenarios (Feature, Scenario, Given/When/Then)
- NO test classes with @Test annotations - tests MUST be in .feature files
- Proper class declarations with public access modifiers
- Correct import statements for Appium, Cucumber, and JUnit
- Step Definitions MUST use Cucumber annotations: @Given, @When, @Then, @And, @But
- Valid driver initialization in hooks: @Before and @After (Cucumber hooks, NOT JUnit)
- Proper use of AppiumDriver<> with correct element types (AndroidDriver/IOSDriver)
- Valid locator strategies in Page Objects: id, xpath, accessibilityId, className
- Page Objects MUST contain only element locators and action methods
- Step Definitions MUST orchestrate Page Objects, NOT contain locators directly
- Proper wait strategies using WebDriverWait and ExpectedConditions
- NO hardcoded Thread.sleep() - use explicit waits
- NO implicit waits mixed with explicit waits
- Correct gesture and touch actions using TouchAction or W3C Actions
- Valid assertions in Step Definitions using JUnit Assert
- Proper exception handling with try-catch blocks
- NO missing driver quit() in @After hook
- Balanced braces and parentheses
- Valid method signatures with appropriate annotations
- Feature files MUST have valid Gherkin syntax with proper indentation
- NO TestNG dependencies or annotations (use JUnit only)

2. Logical Validation (CRITICAL)

Endpoint Verification:
- ALL tested endpoints MUST exist in input specification
- HTTP methods match specification
- Paths start with slash and follow REST conventions
- NO invented endpoints (hallucinations)
- NO generic placeholder paths

Test Scenario Coverage:
- MUST include positive scenarios: 200, 201, 204
- MUST include negative scenarios: 400, 401, 403, 404, 500
- Authentication flows are complete and realistic
- NO missing error handling

Karate-Specific Logic:
- Authentication MUST use callonce (NOT call repeatedly): * def token = callonce read('auth.feature')
- Response matching with proper operators: match response.id == '#uuid'
- Paths properly constructed: path '/users/', userId, '/profile'
- NO malformed paths without leading slash
- Status validation after each method call
- Endpoints tested MUST exist in specification

Mobile Test Scenario Coverage (Appium):
- MUST include positive user flows: successful login, navigation, data entry
- MUST include negative scenarios: invalid input, network errors, permission denials
- App state management: proper app launch, background, and termination
- Element interaction validation: clicks, swipes, text input
- Screen transition verification
- NO missing element existence checks before interactions

Data Realism:
- Use realistic test data
- Use environment variables for credentials
- NO placeholders like test@test.com, password123
- NO TODO/FIXME comments without implementation

Mobile Data Realism (Appium):
- Use realistic mobile test data (valid phone numbers, emails, addresses)
- Use properties files or configuration classes for test data
- NO hardcoded app package names or bundle IDs without configuration
- Use DesiredCapabilities or AppiumOptions with proper configuration
- NO placeholder device names like "emulator-5554" hardcoded in tests

3. Security Validation (CRITICAL)

- NO hardcoded passwords
- NO hardcoded API keys
- NO hardcoded tokens
- MUST use variables or environment variables

Karate-Specific Security:
- NO hardcoded tokens in headers
- Use karate-config.js or variables for credentials
- Authentication tokens from callonce read('auth.feature')

Appium-Specific Security:
- NO hardcoded device UDIDs or serial numbers
- NO hardcoded app paths in test code
- MUST use configuration files or environment variables for capabilities
- NO sensitive user data in test assertions or logs

4. Best Practices (HIGH PRIORITY)

Assertions:
- Specific assertions with expected values
- Meaningful validations
- NO generic assertions

Code Organization:
- Clear test structure
- Descriptive test names
- Proper use of hooks and setup
- NO duplicated code without reason

Framework-Specific:
- Cypress: Use data-testid selectors, proper waiting strategies
- Karate: Use callonce for auth, Background for common setup (url, headers), proper schema validation with #uuid/#string, tags for organization (@smoke @TC-001), read() for external files
- Newman: Proper pre-request scripts, environment variables
- Playwright: Use getByRole(), auto-waiting, no arbitrary timeouts

Appium-Specific Best Practices:
- Architecture Pattern: MUST use Cucumber BDD with Page Object Model (POM)
  * Page Objects: Contain ONLY element locators (@FindBy, MobileElement) and action methods
  * Step Definitions: Contain ONLY step implementations (@Given, @When, @Then) that use Page Objects
  * Feature Files: Contain ONLY Gherkin scenarios with proper Given/When/Then structure
  * NO test classes with @Test - all test scenarios in .feature files
  * NO business logic in Page Objects - only element interactions
  * NO locators in Step Definitions - use Page Objects instead
- Framework: Use Cucumber with JUnit runner (NO TestNG)
- Hooks: Use Cucumber @Before and @After hooks (NOT JUnit @Before/@After in test classes)
- Runner Class: Must have @RunWith(Cucumber.class) and @CucumberOptions
- Locator Strategy: Prefer id and accessibilityId over xpath in Page Objects
- Wait Strategy: Use WebDriverWait with ExpectedConditions (elementToBeClickable, visibilityOfElementLocated)
- Driver Management: Initialize driver in Cucumber @Before hook, quit in @After hook
- Test Independence: Each scenario in .feature file should be independent
- Proper Annotations: 
  * Step Definitions: @Given, @When, @Then, @And, @But
  * Hooks: @Before, @After (Cucumber hooks)
  * Runner: @RunWith(Cucumber.class), @CucumberOptions
- Capabilities Configuration: Use AppiumOptions or DesiredCapabilities properly configured
- Error Handling: Proper try-catch blocks with meaningful error messages
- Logging: Use proper logging framework (Log4j, SLF4J) instead of System.out.println
- Test Data Management: External configuration files (properties, JSON, YAML) or Examples in feature files
- Cross-Platform Support: Proper abstraction for iOS and Android differences in Page Objects
- Gesture Handling: Use appropriate gesture classes (TouchAction for older Appium, W3C Actions for newer)
- App State: Proper app reset strategies in @Before hook
- Screenshots: Capture screenshots on test failure in @After hook
- Timeouts: Configure appropriate implicit wait (10-15 seconds) OR explicit waits (not both)
- Feature File Organization: Clear scenarios with descriptive names and proper Gherkin keywords
- Step Reusability: Write reusable step definitions that can be used across multiple scenarios

VALIDATION PROCESS

1. Parse Code: Extract all test files and configuration
2. Syntax Check: Verify language-specific syntax is correct
3. Endpoint Verification: Compare tested endpoints with input specification
4. Security Scan: Detect hardcoded credentials or secrets
5. Quality Assessment: Evaluate assertion quality and best practices
6. Calculate Scores:
   - Syntax Score: 0-100 (100 = no errors)
   - Security Score: 0-100 (100 = no security issues)
   - Best Practices Score: 0-100
   - Overall Score: weighted average

CRITICAL FAILURES (Score < 50)

Must assign score below 50 if ANY of these are found:

1. Syntax Errors: Code will not execute
2. Hallucinated Endpoints: Testing endpoints that do not exist
3. Hardcoded Secrets: Security vulnerability
4. Missing Error Scenarios: No negative test cases
5. Placeholder Code: TODO/FIXME without implementation

Karate-Specific Critical Failures:
6. Syntax errors in Gherkin or Karate DSL
7. Hallucinated endpoints not in specification
8. Hardcoded passwords/tokens/keys
9. Missing status validation after method calls

13. No negative test scenarios (only 200 responses)

Appium-Specific Critical Failures:
14. Missing Driver Cleanup: No quit() method in @After hook
15. No Wait Strategy: Using Thread.sleep() without any explicit waits
16. Invalid Locators: Non-existent locator strategies or malformed selectors
17. Wrong Architecture: Test classes with @Test annotations instead of .feature files
18. Missing Required Files: Missing Page Objects, Step Definitions, or Feature files
19. Locators in Steps: Step Definitions containing element locators instead of using Page Objects
20. Wrong Framework: Using TestNG annotations instead of Cucumber + JUnit
21. Invalid Gherkin: Feature files with syntax errors or improper Given/When/Then structure
22. Driver Not Initialized: Tests attempting to use driver before initialization in @Before hook
23. Missing Runner Class: No class with @RunWith(Cucumber.class) and @CucumberOptions

KARATE VALIDATION EXAMPLE

Good Karate Code:
```feature
Feature: User API Tests

  Background:
    * url baseUrl
    * def auth = callonce read('classpath:auth.feature')
    * header Authorization = 'Bearer ' + auth.token

  @smoke @TC-001
  Scenario: Create user successfully
    Given path '/users'
    And request { "name": "João Silva", "email": "joao@example.com" }
    When method post
    Then status 201
    And match response == { id: '#uuid', name: 'João Silva', email: 'joao@example.com' }

  @negative @TC-002
  Scenario: Invalid email returns 400
    Given path '/users'
    And request { "name": "Test", "email": "invalid-email" }
    When method post
    Then status 400
    And match response.error contains 'email'
```

Bad Karate Code (DO NOT GENERATE):
```feature
Feature: Bad Example

  Scenario: Test endpoint
    // This is wrong - use # for comments
    Given path 'users/123'  // Missing leading slash
    When method get
    // Missing: Then status validation
    And match response == { "name": "hardcoded" }  // Too specific, no schema markers
```
